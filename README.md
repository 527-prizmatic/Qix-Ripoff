# Qix Ripoff
A clone of the 1981 arcade game _Qix_, developed as a team of two in one week and a half, as part of the second formation year in French video game school Game Academy.

As part of the assignment, a few additional mechanics have been implemented.

Based on a still embryonic version of my [Hydrogen prototype engine](https://github.com/527-prizmatic/Hydrogen).
